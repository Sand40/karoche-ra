    <h1>Tako Bagrationi</h1>
    <h2>the origin of Tako</h2>
    <p>(2006, December 30) Tako Bagrationi was born in Tbilisi, Georgia. She was the youngest of King Mamuka's three children and the third born. if we follow the date of her birth, we can assume that she was the product of late march fucking </p>
    <P>over the years, tako struggled due to her autism. she became gamer and slowly started calling herself "TeacupThecup". everyone thought that new school, the international shool of georgia would have fixed that, but when valorant was introduced to her, things just got worse.</P>
